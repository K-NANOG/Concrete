# Concrete - Brutalist Architecture Generator

A generative design platform for creating brutalist architectural structures, emphasizing raw concrete forms and bold geometric compositions.

![Concrete Generator Demo](docs/demo.gif)

## Overview

Concrete is an interactive web-based tool that generates 3D brutalist architectural structures. It uses procedural generation techniques and architectural principles to create unique, bold geometric compositions that embody the essence of brutalist architecture.

## Features

- 🏗️ 3D visualization of brutalist architectural structures
- 🔄 Hybrid composition system combining horizontal and vertical elements
- 🎨 Minimalist, concrete-inspired UI
- 🎲 Procedural generation with architectural principles
- 💡 Real-time 3D rendering with dynamic lighting

## Live Demo

## Tech Stack

- Next.js with TypeScript for the frontend framework
- Three.js for 3D graphics rendering
- Custom brutalist generation algorithms
- Emotion for styled components
